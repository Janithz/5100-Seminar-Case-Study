# No, I'm not using the original MATLAB code to guide the R code. I'm solely relying on the data and your description of the task to help you with the R code. If there's anything specific you'd like to replicate from the MATLAB code or if you have any preferences on how the final plot should look, please let me know, and I'll adjust the R code accordingly!

# You
# the matlab code does the task. it may be easiest to rely on that as a start
# 
# ChatGPT
# Certainly! Let's use the MATLAB code as a reference to ensure the R code achieves the same task. Here's the R code based on the MATLAB script you provided:

# Load ABR row data
ABRtext <- read.table('ABR-0-1.txt')

# Extract ABR data
ABR <- as.matrix(ABRtext)

# Get dimensions of ABR data
s <- dim(ABR)
fr <- 40
frame <- 1:s[1]

# Final Figure
plot_colors <- rainbow(s[2])

plot(frame / fr, ABR[, 1] + (1 * 4), type = 'l', col = plot_colors[1], lwd = 1,
     xlim = c(-5, 12.4), ylim = c(1.3, 33.1), xlab = 'Time (s)', ylab = 'Y-axis label')

for (i in 2:s[2]) {
  lines(frame / fr, ABR[, i] + (i * 4), col = plot_colors[i], lwd = 1)
}

box()
axis(1, at = NA)
axis(2, at = NA)
#This R code should produce a similar plot to the MATLAB script you provided. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
