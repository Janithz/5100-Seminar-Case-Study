# Got it. If the data contains multiple waveforms based on different levels, we need to extract those levels and then plot each waveform separately. Here's how you can modify the code to achieve that:

# Read the file line by line
ABRtext <- readLines('ABR-0-1.txt')

# Find the index of the line containing the ":DATA" marker
data_start_index <- grep(":DATA", ABRtext)

# Extract numerical data from lines after the ":DATA" marker
data_lines <- ABRtext[(data_start_index + 1):length(ABRtext)]

# Convert the tab-separated values to a numeric matrix
data_matrix <- as.matrix(read.table(text = data_lines))

# Extract levels
levels_line <- ABRtext[grep(":LEVELS", ABRtext)]
levels <- as.numeric(strsplit(levels_line, ":")[[1]][2])

# Plot each waveform based on levels
for (i in 1:length(levels)) {
  start_index <- (i - 1) * nrow(data_matrix) / length(levels) + 1
  end_index <- i * nrow(data_matrix) / length(levels)
  waveform <- data_matrix[start_index:end_index,]
  lines(waveform, type = "l", col = i, lwd = 1, 
        xlab = "Data Point Index", ylab = "Data Value",
        main = "Graph of Selected Data")
}

# Add legend for levels
legend("topright", legend = levels, col = 1:length(levels), lwd = 1, bty = "n")
# In this code:
# 
# We first extract the numerical data from the lines following the :DATA marker.
# Then, we extract the levels from the line containing :LEVELS.
# We plot each waveform based on the levels using different colors.
# Finally, we add a legend to indicate the levels.
# This code should generate multiple waveforms on the graph, each corresponding to a different level. Adjustments can be made as necessary depending on the specific structure of your data. Let me know if you need further assistance!
