# It seems there's still an issue with reading the data or plotting it correctly. Let's troubleshoot this step by step. We'll start by examining the structure of the data after reading it to ensure it's parsed correctly. Here's how we can do that:
# 
# # Read the file line by line
# ABRtext <- readLines('ABR-0-1.txt')
# 
# # Find the index of the line containing the ":DATA" marker
# data_start_index <- grep(":DATA", ABRtext)
# 
# # Extract numerical data from lines after the ":DATA" marker
# data_lines <- ABRtext[(data_start_index + 1):length(ABRtext)]
# 
# # Print the first few lines of the data
# head(data_lines)

#This code will print the first few lines of the data after the ":DATA" marker. It will help us ensure that the data is read correctly and that there are no parsing issues. Please run this code and let me know what output you get. We can then proceed from there to diagnose and fix the issue.

# The output suggests that the data lines are read correctly, with each line containing tab-separated numerical values. Now let's proceed to convert these lines into a numeric matrix and attempt to plot it. If this step still results in a garbled plot, we may need to inspect the data matrix further or adjust the plotting parameters. Here's how we can convert the data lines into a numeric matrix and plot it:

# Convert the tab-separated values to a numeric matrix
data_matrix <- as.matrix(read.table(text = data_lines, sep = "\t"))

# Plot each waveform based on levels
plot(data_matrix, type = "l", col = "black", lwd = 1, 
     xlab = "Data Point Index", ylab = "Data Value",
     main = "Graph of Selected Data")

#Please run this code and let me know if you encounter any issues with the resulting plot. We'll troubleshoot further based on the outcome.

#Prompt 16
# You
# this is ignoring that each column represents a different frequency; would it be helpful to establish that?
#   
# ChatGPT
# Absolutely, establishing that each column represents a different frequency is crucial for accurate plotting. Let's modify the code to account for this. We'll extract the frequencies from the data file and use them to label the plot accordingly.
# 
# Here's the modified code:

# Extract frequencies from the first line after ":DATA"
freq_line <- ABRtext[data_start_index + 1]
frequencies <- as.numeric(unlist(strsplit(freq_line, "\t")))

# Convert the tab-separated values to a numeric matrix
data_matrix <- as.matrix(read.table(text = data_lines, sep = "\t"))

# Plot each waveform based on frequencies
plot_colors <- rainbow(ncol(data_matrix))

plot(1, type = "n", xlim = c(1, nrow(data_matrix)), ylim = range(data_matrix), 
     xlab = "Data Point Index", ylab = "Data Value", 
     main = "Graph of Selected Data")

for (i in 1:ncol(data_matrix)) {
  waveform <- data_matrix[, i]
  lines(waveform, type = "l", col = plot_colors[i], lwd = 1)
}

# Add legend for frequencies
legend("topright", legend = frequencies, col = plot_colors, lwd = 1, bty = "n", title = "Frequencies")
# In this code:
# 
# We extract the frequencies from the first line after ":DATA" and convert them to numeric values.
# Each waveform is plotted with a different color, and the frequencies are used as labels in the legend.
# Please try running this code and let me know if it produces the desired plot. If there are any further adjustments needed or if you encounter any issues, feel free to let me know!
