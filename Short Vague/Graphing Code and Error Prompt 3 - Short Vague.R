# It seems like there was an issue with how the plot function was called. Let's revise the code to ensure it handles the data correctly:

# Read the file line by line
ABRtext <- readLines('ABR-0-1.txt')

# Filter lines containing data (starting with ":")
data_lines <- grep("^:", ABRtext, value = TRUE, invert = TRUE)

# Extract numerical data from selected lines
# Assuming numerical data follows the pattern ":Key: Value"
# Modify the regular expression pattern based on the actual structure of your data
data_values <- sapply(data_lines, function(line) {
  match <- regmatches(line, regexpr(":([-+]?[0-9]*\\.?[0-9]+(?:[eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?)", line))
  as.numeric(sub("^:", "", match))
})

# Flatten the list of data values
data_values <- unlist(data_values)

# Plot the extracted data
plot(data_values, type = "l", col = "black", lwd = 1, 
     xlab = "Data Point Index", ylab = "Data Value",
     main = "Graph of Selected Data")

# In this revised code, I've added unlist to flatten the list of data values before plotting. This should resolve the issue you encountered. If you still face any issues or if you have further questions, feel free to ask!
